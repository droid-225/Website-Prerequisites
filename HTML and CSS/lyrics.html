            [Verse 1]
            Do I look lonely? I see the shadows on my face
            People have told me I don't look the same
            Maybe I lost weight, I'm playing hooky with the best of the best
            Pull my heart out my chest, so that you can see it too

            [Pre-Chorus]
            I'm walking the long road, watching the sky fall
            The lace in your dress tangles my neck, how do I live?

            [Chorus]
            The death of a bachelor, o-o-oh! Letting the water fall
            The death of a bachelor, o-o-oh! Seems so fitting for
            Happily ever after, ooh, how could I ask for more?
            A lifetime of laughter at the expense of the death of a bachelor

            [Verse 2]
            I'm cutting my mind off, feels like my heart is going to burst
            Alone at a table for two, and I just wanna be served
            And when you think of me, am I the best you've ever had?
            Share one more drink with me, smile even though you're sad

            [Pre-Chorus]
            I'm walking the long road, watching the sky fall
            The lace in your dress tangles my neck, how do I live?
            
            [Chorus]
            The death of a bachelor, o-o-oh! Letting the water fall
            The death of a bachelor, o-o-oh! Seems so fitting for
            Happily ever after, ooh, how could I ask for more?
            A lifetime of laughter at the expense of the death of a bachelor

            [Instrumental Bridge]

            [Chorus]
            The death of a bachelor, o-o-oh! Letting the water fall
            The death of a bachelor, o-o-oh! Seems so fitting for
            Happily ever after, ooh, how could I ask for more?
            A lifetime of laughter at the expense of the death of a bachelor
